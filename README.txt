Getting the theme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Zip file
++++++++++

If you are an end user, you might enjoy installation via zip file import.

    1. Download a `zip file <https://github.com/imatem/plonetheme.unam/plonetheme.unam.zip>`_ 
        
    2. Upload the theme from the Theming control panel.

Buildout
++++++++++

If you are a developer, you might enjoy installing it via buildout.

Add ``plonetheme.unam`` to your ``plone.recipe.zope2instance`` section's *eggs* parameter e.g.::

    [instance]
    eggs =
        Plone
        ...
        plonetheme.unam

Or, you can add it as a dependency on your own product *setup.py*::

    install_requires=[
        ...
        'plonetheme.unam',
    ],
